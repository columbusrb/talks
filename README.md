# CRB Talk Manager

Add new talks to the docket, schedule interesting talks for the next meeting, ensure we don't have to watch Pirate Yoga again.

## Development

You'll need to have PostgreSQL installed.

```bash
$ git clone git@git.columbusrb.com:columbusrb/crb-talk
$ script/setup
```

### Issues

We've filed a number of issues in the hopes that folks who want a low-risk (but still important!) project to sharpen their skills on will pick them up.

### Contributing

1. Clone this repository.
2. `git checkout -b my_new_feature`
3. Make your changes
4. `git push origin HEAD`
5. Open a merge request

Feel free to open a merge request as soon as you have any kind of code at all. Earlier discussion is better than putting weeks of effort into a change, only to have folks shoot it down.

Please discuss changes in Slack or in the CRB Mailing List.
